## About

### This Fork

This fork is based on the theme by Start Bootstrap. Long story short, I used this theme on my personal Jekyll blogs and I loved it, but there are some features I wish were there. Therefore, I wrote and tested them on my blog. As I want to share the features I developed with more people, I decided to make it available on a forked repo.
